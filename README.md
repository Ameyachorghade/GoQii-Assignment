I could've used UIkit As well but i was having some issues in my Storybaord. probably some Xcode bug. so i went Ahead with SwiftUI. i could have added some more UI tweaks like Adding water sound when adding water intake. could have used more elements which resembles fitness and Water intake Goals.

Hoping to hear soon from you Guys. :)
